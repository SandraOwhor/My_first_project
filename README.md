## Project Questions:
* What were some of the most trending search topics on Wikipedia on the following days? Using the provided dataset, can you show some evidence to support your answer? a- New year's day b- November 8, 2016?

* Which page experienced the biggest decline in page visits during 2016?

* Which page experienced the biggest increase in page visits during 2016?

* Wikipedia pages could be written in several languages. How many languages are represented in this dataset? What proportion of the pages does each language represent?

**Hint:** One may infer which language a page is written in based on the page name e.g. Special:Search_fr.wikipedia.org_all-access_all-agents is written in French and Special:Book_en.wikipedia.org_all-access_spider is written in English.

* Based on the provided dataset, which day(s) of the week is/are the most popular for visiting wikipedia?

* Based on the provided dataset, which day(s) of the week is/are the least popular for visiting wikipedia?

* Based on the dataset provided, which device type is used more frequently for visiting wikipedia i.e. desktop or mobile devices?

**Hint:** For some of the pages in the dataset, it is possible to distinguish whether the visits to the page came from a desktop or a mobile device. For example, consider Barack Obama's wikipedia page:
Barack_Obama_en.wikipedia.org_desktop_all-agents : these visits came from desktop devices.
Barack_Obama_en.wikipedia.org_mobile-web_all-agents: these visits came from mobile devices.
